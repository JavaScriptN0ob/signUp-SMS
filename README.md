This is a sign-up component, after customer enter their personal details and application will call TelstraAPI sending a random 6 digits code to provided phone number.
Customer need to enter the code they received to the input for finishing their sign-up.

features had been finished:
  1. Validation on username, Australian phone number had been finished.
  2. 6 digits random security code could be generated by a function.
  3. TelstraAPI now working properly both on Postman/backend axios, and could send code to a phone number.

Bugs for now:
  1. CORS blocking of if I put axios call TelstraAPI sending message, so I have to put the SendCode at backend of NodeJs.
